		<h1>Help</h1>At this page you can get help if you have problems with the system.<p></p><b>Logging into the system</b><br />To be able to log into the system you need to have a valid KTH account. 
    If you have an account and you still can not log in, the problem is not in the KTH-EXIT system. 
    If that is the case, you need to contact KTH administration. </p>
